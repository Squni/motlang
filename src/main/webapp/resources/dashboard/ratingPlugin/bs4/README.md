# Bootstrap4 Rating Input

Forked from https://github.com/javiertoledo/bootstrap-rating-input

I just update bootstrap version to 4.0.0 and new fontawesome icons.

As a new specification div render! 

It's mean is no more inputs without form.  

```
  <div class="rating">4</div>
```

Thanks @javiertoledo
